# DOT Files

My repository for dotfiles. This is meant to store my profiles so I can move easily between devices with minimal configuration.

## How to Use
Clone this repository. I use git root path as an anchor, so this needs to be a git repository on your local.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:yohanesmario/dotfiles.git
```

## How to Apply
Run `global-apply` script.

## Profiles
- [Terminal](terminal) (dotfiles for xterm and tmux)
